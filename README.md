#Purpose

The purpose of the project was to investigate risk factors for child anemia in India while controlling for district. Child anemia prevalence is shockingly high in India, and discovering risk factors may help to guide public health initiatives designed to address this public health concern. Additionally, because metabolic disorders such as diabetes and hypertension are growing, risk factors for these conditions were analyzed as well.
